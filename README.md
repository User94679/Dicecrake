#Dicedrake

##What we aim to achieve

Dicedrake will someday become the tool for those Dungeons and Dragons players who have had enough of half baked virtual tools. We want, in the longrun, to create a tool that people can use to connect with eachother through the game, indiscriminate of what you may or may not have content wise. 

I started playing Dungeons and Dragons in the december of twenty twenty, and since then I have found myself baffeled by the number of inconveniences there are that players need to work arround when playing with people online. So I aim to create a new tool. something that will allow people to view official content, add and share their own without things becoming an unorganised mixing pot, and be able to copy the entries they wish to directly into their character's sheet. no fuss no hassle.

currently this doubles as a school project, but in time I hope to go from a complete prototype to a version that people can enjoy.

##Plans along the way

I have met many different and diverse people while playing, leading me to discover just how vast the range of needs this community has, and as a result, seeing the many oversights on distribution giants such as roll 20 and dnd beyond in reguards to accessability for players. especially in reguards to vision impairment which is what I have aimed this project to aid with. while beimg designed for everyonem, it will be targeted at those that previous software forgot to consider in thier development.

currnetly, as of 11/15/2021, I only have some barebones functions that I have coded in python, some of which have to be edited and made more efficient, but in time, I am working to create a beautiful program wiht multiple layers of customisation in built, character sheet designer and tracker, dice roller and in the longterm development, virtual tabletop integration.
